### Introduction to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to control the appearance, layout, and design of HTML documents. While HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage, CSS is responsible for the visual presentation. This separation of content (HTML) and design (CSS) makes it easier to maintain and style websites efficiently.

### Key Features of CSS:
1. **Separation of Concerns**: CSS separates the content (HTML) from the presentation (styles).
2. **Cascading Rules**: Styles can cascade, meaning they can inherit and override rules based on priority (inline, internal, or external CSS).
3. **Responsive Design**: CSS allows you to build responsive websites that look good on various screen sizes and devices.
4. **Selector-based**: CSS styles can be applied to specific HTML elements using selectors like element name, class, or ID.

### CSS Syntax
CSS is made up of **selectors** and **declarations**. The selector targets the HTML elements you want to style, and the declaration defines how those elements should look.

```css
/* CSS Syntax */
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

### Example:
Here’s a simple CSS rule that sets the text color of paragraphs (`<p>`) to blue:

```css
p {
    color: blue;
}
```

### Types of CSS
There are three ways to apply CSS to HTML:

1. **Inline CSS**: Styles are applied directly to individual HTML elements.
2. **Internal CSS**: Styles are written inside a `<style>` tag in the HTML file's `<head>`.
3. **External CSS**: A separate CSS file is linked to the HTML document.

#### 1. Inline CSS
You can apply styles directly within the HTML tag using the `style` attribute. This method is not recommended for large projects because it mixes structure and style.

```html
<p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>
```

#### 2. Internal CSS
Internal CSS is defined within the `<style>` element inside the `<head>` section of the HTML file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        p {
            color: blue;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is a blue paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### 3. External CSS
External CSS is the best practice for applying styles because it keeps the HTML file clean and separates the content from presentation. You create a `.css` file and link it to your HTML document.

**HTML File:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is a blue paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**CSS File (`styles.css`):**
```css
p {
    color: blue;
}
```

### CSS Selectors
Selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling. Some common selectors include:

1. **Element Selector**: Targets all elements of a specific type.
    ```css
    p {
        color: red;
    }
    ```

2. **Class Selector**: Targets elements with a specific class attribute. Classes are reusable.
    ```css
    .my-class {
        font-size: 20px;
    }
    ```

    In HTML:
    ```html
    <p class="my-class">This paragraph has a custom style.</p>
    ```

3. **ID Selector**: Targets a single element with a unique ID. IDs should be unique on a page.
    ```css
    #my-id {
        background-color: yellow;
    }
    ```

    In HTML:
    ```html
    <p id="my-id">This paragraph has a yellow background.</p>
    ```

4. **Universal Selector**: Targets all elements on the page.
    ```css
    * {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
    }
    ```

### Common CSS Properties

1. **Text Properties**:
   ```css
   p {
       color: blue;
       font-size: 16px;
       text-align: center;
   }
   ```

2. **Backgrounds**:
   ```css
   body {
       background-color: #f0f0f0;
       background-image: url('background.jpg');
   }
   ```

3. **Box Model** (Margin, Border, Padding, Width, Height):
   The box model defines how elements are structured in terms of spacing and layout.
   ```css
   div {
       width: 300px;
       height: 200px;
       margin: 10px;
       padding: 20px;
       border: 1px solid black;
   }
   ```

4. **Layout Properties**:
   - **Display**: Controls how elements are displayed.
   ```css
   div {
       display: block;
   }

   span {
       display: inline;
   }
   ```

   - **Position**: Controls the position of elements relative to their normal flow or other elements.
   ```css
   div {
       position: absolute;
       top: 50px;
       left: 100px;
   }
   ```

   - **Flexbox**: A modern layout system for creating flexible and responsive layouts.
   ```css
   .container {
       display: flex;
       justify-content: space-between;
   }
   ```

### Responsive Design with Media Queries
Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the size of the screen (responsive design).

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
    }
}
```

### Conclusion
CSS is an essential technology for designing beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly websites. It gives you control over the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of web pages. By using CSS efficiently, you can build engaging web experiences that work well on any device or screen size.
